# List all channels
pnpm run manage-config channel list

# Update a channel name or webhook
pnpm run manage-config channel update "Gaming Deals" --name "PC Gaming"
pnpm run manage-config channel update "Gaming Deals" --webhook "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/new-url"

# Delete a channel (also removes all its search terms)
pnpm run manage-config channel delete "Gaming Deals"
```

### Search Term Management

# Add a search term to a channel
pnpm run manage-config add "Gaming Deals" steam-deck

## Feed Parser (Development)

```

## Configuration Structure

Data is stored in DynamoDB using a single-table design with ElectroDB:

### Channel
```typescript
interface Channel {
  channelId: string;       // Auto-generated UUID
  name: string;            // Friendly name (e.g., "Gaming Deals")
  webhookUrl: string;      // Discord webhook URL
  createdAt?: string;
  updatedAt?: string;
}
```

### SearchTermConfig
```typescript
interface SearchTermConfig {
  channelId: string;         // References Channel
  searchTerm: string;        // Search keyword
  enabled: boolean;          // Enable/disable notifications
  excludeKeywords: string[]; // Keywords to exclude from results
  includeKeywords: string[]; // Keywords that must be present
  caseSensitive: boolean;    // Case-sensitive filtering
  createdAt?: string;
  updatedAt?: string;
}
```

### Deal
```typescript
interface Deal {
  dealId: string;          // Unique deal ID from HotUKDeals
  searchTerm: string;      // Search term that found this deal
  title: string;           // Deal title
  link: string;            // Direct link to deal
  price?: string;          // Deal price
  merchant?: string;       // Merchant name
  timestamp?: number;      // When the deal was processed
  ttl?: number;            // Auto-expires after 12 months
}
```
